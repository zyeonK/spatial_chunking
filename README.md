## Instruction for use
### Data
#### node_indiv.mat
This .mat file contains the node sizes and spacing scales for each participant obtained from the multi-sesssion experiment.
#### sample_data.mat
This .mat file contains x, y coordinates of target coins and responses, as well as subject id, session #, coin order #, context # obtained from the multi-session experiment.
#### neural_task_period_info
This folder contains task period information for the fMRI session.

### Code
#### behav_code1_target_response_pattern_analysis.m
Code that can generate the results in Figure 1b along with the pattern similarity analysis.
#### behav_code2_target_response_pattern_analysis_across_errors.m
Code that can generate the results in Figure 1c along with the pattern similarity analysis.
#### behav_code3_boundary_proximity_model.m
Code that can generate the results in Figure 1d.
#### behav_code4_autocorrelation.m
Code that can generate the results in Figure 1e.
#### behav_code5_error_vector_map.m
Code that can generate the results in Figure 1f.
#### behav_code6_multi_node_model.m
Code used to test the best fitting multi-node model for each participant. This code generates the results in Figure 1h.
#### behav_code7_chunking_index_analysis.m
Code used to generate the results in Figure 2 & Figure 3d
#### behav_code8_chunking_and_boundary_interaction.m
